Contours detection is a process can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along with the boundary), 
having same colour or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition. 
So how is the contour is different than finding an Edge? An edge is a point in an image where 
there is a sharp change in the pixel colour value which doesn’t make it continuous in nature and sometimes makes 
it hard to determine the shape of the object. 
Contours can do a bit more than “just” detect edges. The algorithm does indeed find edges of image
