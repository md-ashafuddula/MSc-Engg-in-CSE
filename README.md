# MSc (resources)

My MSc duration was **(Jan, 2020 to Jan, 2023) exactly 3 years**. By the grace of almighty Allah I have completed my course work and 1 thesis publication.
During my MSc I have taken 7 course though could not participate in the final exam of **Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing** Course. However, I have completed all it's assignment,
project and Presentation.

**Thesis book (pdf) modification src:**

1.  https://pdfresizer.com/crop
2.  https://smallpdf.com/

**Image enhancer**

1.  https://picwish.com/
2.  https://www.media.io/
3.  https://pinetools.com/sharpen-image

**Draw figs**

1.  https://app.diagrams.net/

**Tpis and Tricks**

1.  Use ``pdf version`` of every image to get the best quality
2.  Use ``Latex`` for easy and better organization
3.  Import ``pdf`` figs
4.  Use python ``matplot`` lib for ``pdf`` format image extraction
5.  Notice that no overlapping happens in ``curve and legend``
